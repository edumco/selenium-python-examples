It contains examples of:
    - Finding and interact with elements using its id, name, CSS selector, tag name, XPATH ...
    - How to get the contents of an element and parse it into lists
    - Test parametrization (to reuse tests with different inputs)
    - How to use test fixtures to simplefy configuration
    - Automatic configuration based on suytem information

## Before you start

Before you start, you NEED to know 3 informations:

__Your operational system__: It's the software that you use to run your applications! This software works on:

    1. Windows = The most common, almost everybody uses
    2. MacOs = Comes only with computers from Apple
    3. Linux = A free and secure alternative

__Your browser__: That little window you use to view websites. This software works with:

    1. Google Chrome (and Chromium on linux)
    2. Microsof Edge (that is very similar to Chrome)
    2. Firefox (a diferent engine)

__If you have Python on your machine__: It can be download for free but you gonna need administrative permitions to install.

#### 2. Install or update your browser

__[Arquivo ZIP ðŸ“‚](https://github.com/edumco/selenium-python-examples/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)__

After uncompress navigate to the main folder and click on one of the runners: `run_on_windows.bat` or `run_on_linux_or_mac.sh`

If it does not open try calling [via terminal](https://www.lifewire.com/open-command-prompt-in-folder-8681085) or [change the file permitions](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-permissions-for-files-folders-or-disks-mchlp1203/mac)

## Project overview

Heres a simple overview from this source code:

selenium-python-examples/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”œâ”€â”€ drivers/
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”” ...

The most important file is the config.py
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.py

It keeps all the configurations together so you dont need to search the entire project when something changes

On the `drivers` folder are located the files Selenium necessary to comunicate with the browser

Another very important file is the conftest.py
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conftest.py

It provides the fixtures so the test resources can be easily initialized and released

On the `pages` folder you get the page object pattern implemented by representing each website with a different class

And finally on the `tests` folder you find the actual tests that glue together all the parts:

1. Use the configurations from config.py
2. Receive resources from the fixtures
3. Use the methods form the page objects

Hope you enjoy!
